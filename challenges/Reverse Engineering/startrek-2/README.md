## Description

The USS Enterprise receives a distress signal from a Federation research station on the remote planet of Xylophia-IV. The station's scientists were conducting experiments on a newly discovered ancient alien artifact, but their transmissions suddenly ceased. Sensors indicate unusual energy fluctuations emanating from the planet's surface.
With the power of the Quantum Key unlocked, the Starships now have enhanced capabilities.  They have more fuel capacity, and can do longer jumps!
... But the universe has gotten bigger as well.                                              
                
Captain Kirk and Captain Spock need your help again to navigate to the research station, determine the cause of the distress signal, and retrieve the ancient artifact.
