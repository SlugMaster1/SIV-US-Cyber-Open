## Description

You are a remote navigator directing Captain Kirk, who is commanding the USS Enterprise, and Captain Spock, who is commanding the USS Endeavour. Your mission is to guide them on a journey 100 galaxies away to an ancient, advanced civilization known as the "Architects" who have hidden a powerful artifact. This artifact, known as the "Quantum Key," has the potential to unlock new dimensions, granting unparalleled knowledge and power to its possessor... 

But your ships' warp drives are limited and as you journey through the galaxies, you discover that some contain ancient portal mechanisms that can instantly transport you to another galaxy. These portals are unpredictable and may send you further ahead (Slipstream Portals) or behind (Wormhole Portals) your current position. Can you strategically navigate these worlds and accomplish your mission on limited fuel?
