# Sicilian Defense

## Description

Our agents have been tracking two hackers for the past several weeks but haven't been able to intercept any of their communications. We were able to recover the recording of a game of chess that the played on a popular gaming service but they never actually said anything in chat. The game notation is very strange and full of interesting, and often illegal, moves by both players.

Maybe you can make sense of it all....
