# Cloud Storage [Misc]

## Description

Have you heard about this "cloud" thing that everyone is using? I think we can save a bunch of money by putting our cat photos there!

I have provided a service account key that you can use to authenticate and check that you can access the photos.

That service account shouldn't have access to anything other than the cat pictures, but this whole "eye aye em" thing is a bit confusing, so I'm not entirely sure!

We can't afford to have another data breach, so we need to be confident that our flags are secure before we make the switch.
