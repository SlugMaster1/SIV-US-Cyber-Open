# I Want to Believe [Forensics]

## Description

We've received a GIFt from what appears to be a signal coming from extraterrestrial life! Although, it appears they've used steganography to hide it inside of this .gif file. All we know is that it's in the form of a text file named 'iwanttobelieve.txt'. Can you recover it?
