# The Email Where It Happens [Forensics]

## Description

Howdy Truth Seekers! It seems that some malware that was strategically shared has begun to phone back home! We believe that this might have some very important information that could help lead us to finally getting to the bottom of this conspiracy regarding extraterrestrial life. Unfortunately the original developer of this *tool* was recently promoted to customer status and is no longer on good terms with the orginization. This means that we don't have any information on how to decode this traffic. Unfortunately all I have is a PCAP. Can you help us out here?
